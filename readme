GENEWEAVER LIB README

ABOUT

	Small library for accessing and altering the GeneWeaver database. Also
	includes two additional modules for logging and miscellaneous utility
	functions.

REQUIREMENTS
	
	python 2.7

INSTALLATION

	Clone the repo and import any necessary modules. 

CONFIGURATION

	The database module requires a configuration file and will automatically 
	create one for you if one does not already exist. The config file must be
	filled out with the proper DB connection information. Below is the list of
	key-value pairs and their types each config should have.

	host
		STRING
		The domain name or IP of a running Postgres server.

	database
		STRING
		The name of a database to connect to.

	port
		INTEGER
		Postgres server port. The default is 5432.

	user
		STRING
		The user to connect as.

	password
		STRING
		Password for the given database and user. 

	autocommit
		BOOLEAN
		If true, the DB module will commit after every statement is executed
		(including SELECT statements). This prevents the server from
		accumulating "idle in transaction" sessions, but isn't recommended for
		script testing and dry runs.

	usr_id
		INTEGER
		The GW usr_id to use when performing insertions that require a user ID.
